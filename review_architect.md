# Architect Review

**Overall Assessment**: The code structure is excellent.

- [x] **Modularity**: The project is well-structured into `backend` and `frontend`. The backend's separation into `api`, `core`, and `models` follows best practices.
- [x] **Scalability**: The use of `APIRouter` in FastAPI makes the API easy to extend with new endpoints.
- [x] **Clarity**: The code is easy to understand and navigate.

**Result**: NO_ISSUES
